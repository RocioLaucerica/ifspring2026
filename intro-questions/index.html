        <li>Provide your name, major, year in school (sophomore, junior, etc).</li>
        <p>Hi! My name is Rocio and I'm a Sophomore majoring in Architecture, minoring in design</p>
        <li>Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.</li>
        <p>This course applied for my design minor but overall I'm very passionate about finding new ways to be creative and experimenting with artistic mediums, both digital and traditional.</p>
        <li>Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit about it.</li>
        <p>I have absolutely no experience with HTML/CSS/JS :(</p>
        <li>Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.</li>
        <p>I hope to learn the basics on how to properly design a website and eventually be able to apply that to my architecture work</p>
        <li>Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</li>
        <p>I expect designing for screen to be a bit more complicated and precise and definitely have more memorization as opposed to the free-reign creativity that designing on paper has.</p>
        <li>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</li>
        <p><a href="https://wearebreakfast.com/">https://wearebreakfast.com/</a></p>
        <p>This website is just so pleasing and attractive to me as a viewer which I think makes it very effective because it draws people in and keeps them interested in staying on the website through its interactive elements and overall unique and creative design format that I think is really conducive to keeping potential buyers engaged.</p>
        <li>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.</li>
        <p><a href="https://www.archdaily.com/">https://www.archdaily.com/</a></p>
        <p>ArchDaily provides immediate clarity of purpose when opening the site: architecture projects on the left and architecture news to the right with clear labeling for further information and good hierarchy of scale (not bombarded with too much text or too little information). </p>
        <li>Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.</li>
        <p><a href="https://www.peculiarmanicule.com/">https://www.peculiarmanicule.com/</a></p>
        <p>I personally just love this website, it's not only often so useful and creatively inspiring, its also very clear to use, each category of graphic design is sorted into subcategories with their own subcategories within them and it makes it very easy to find an exact reference.</p>
